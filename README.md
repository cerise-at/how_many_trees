<!-- Background and Rationale -->
## Background and Rationale:
Transport emissions make up a significant part of global emissions by sector. According to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/transport/">IPCC 2014 WG3 Report,</a> 22% of global emissions come from transport. If we break down transport emissions, 74% of transport sector emissions come from cars (40% of sector emissions) and lorries (34% of sector emissions). 

Yet transport emissions and wider emissions in the supply chain are often overlooked in our efforts to transition to a zero-carbon economy. In addition, given the current level of EV deployment, its an area that isn't immediately decarbonisable. At present, efforts to decarbonise transport and logistics chains don't focus on active drawdown (or offsetting in the case of carbon neutrality), but instead focus on emissions trading with sustainability companies. 

How Many Trees is a business-to-business and people-to-business service for those who want to see and track their own freight based carbon costs; see their carbon debt in a clear, easy to understand way (how many trees will it take to offset my footprint?); and give users the tools to make their orders/supply chains carbon neutral by allowing them to track and handle carbon offsets theyâ€™ve invested in.

<!-- CALCULATOR METHODOLOGY -->
## Calculator Methodology: 
Our in-house RESTful API used to calculate emissions per km were derived from the European Chemical Transport Association's *Guidelines for Measuring and Managing CO2
 Emission from Freight Transport Operations* report:

```
[1] CO2 emissions = Transport volume by transport mode (metric tonnes) x transport distance by transport mode (km) x average CO2-emissions per tonne-km by transport mode (g)
```

```
[2] CO2 emissions in metric tonnes = (Eqn. 1) / 1000000
```

For equation 1, we are assuming time components for emissions (such as emissions generated by a vehicle idling or a vehicle stuck in traffic) are negligible, and can thus be ignored. 

Average CO2-emission factor per tonne-km and Transport volume by transport mode were taken from the DVLA Vehicle Enquiry Service API. Transport distance was taken from MapBox API. For our calculations, we have assumed that the transport volume is equal to the vehicles Gross Revenue Weight (GRW) in kilograms, which is defined by the DVLA as:

> *The maximum gross weight: fully laden passengers, luggage, and all.* 

We are assuming the GRW is a constant value across distance travelled. To ensure consistency in our calculations, we converted GRW into metric tonnes by dividing GRW by 1000

The calculation for converting CO2 in metric tonnes into a 'Tree Equivalent' is based on the average mature tree absorbing 21kg of CO2 per year. For simplicity sake, we are assuming all trees are average, all trees are mature, and all trees are eternal (hail trees). 

For a metric tonnage of CO2, 'Tree Equivalent' is calculated using Equn. 3 below:

```
[3] Tree Equivalent = (Eqn. 2) / 0.021
```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* You have Python installed. See https://www.python.org/downloads/ for how to install Python on your system. 
* You have Docker installed. See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ for how to install Docker on your local system.

### Installation and Usage
1. Fork and clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cerise-at/how_many_trees.git
   ```
2. Get your environment up and running: 
    a. cd into the folder containing the Docker Compose file
    b. In your terminal run:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
3. Visit localhost:3000.
4. Finished? Ctrl+C in your application terminal to stop the server, and clean up your system with:
    ```sh
    docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans
    ```
5. Stop Docker\*

* (\* this will depend on your OS- see documentation linked in Prerequisites)
