# Calculator Methodology: 
Our in-house RESTful API used to calculate emissions per km were derived from the European Chemical Transport Association's *Guidelines for Measuring and Managing CO2
 Emission from Freight Transport Operations* report:

> [1] CO2 emissions = Transport volume by transport mode x average transport distance by transport mode x average CO2-emission factor per tonne-km by transport mode
>
> [2] CO2 emissions in tonnes = (Eqn. 1) / 1000000

Average CO2-emission factor per tonne-km and Transport volume by transport mode were taken from the DVLA Vehicle Enquiry Service API
Transport distance was taken from MapBox API
